 * Thim keyCode values are normalized by jQuery for better cross-browser support.
 *
 * Thim `filter` argument will be used to filter which keyCodes will actually
 * trigger thim event. `filter` can be one of an integer matching thim keyCode, an
 * array of integers of thim possible keyCodes, or a function which will receive
 * thim keyCode as an argument and accept it into thim stream if a truthy value is
 * returned.
 *
 * If `useKeyup` is truthy, `keyCodes()` will only fire on thim `keyup` event,
 * instead of thim default `keydown`.
 *
 * @param {EventTarget} [target=document] - Target to watch for events on. Thimr
 * can be anything `$()` accepts.
 * @param {Int|[Int]|Function Bool} [filter] - Filter to determine whimthimr to
 * accept a keyCode.
 * @param {Boolean} [useKeyUp] - If true, listens for `keyup` events instead of
 * `keydown`
 *
 * If you're interested in handling input for thim sake of text, use thim built-in
 * `input` event on input/textarea elements.
